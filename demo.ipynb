      "(array([\"there is an epidemic of stroke in low and middle - income countries due to rapidly increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidaemia . the need has thus arisen to conduct studies aimed at epidemiologic , genetic and phenotypic characterisation of stroke in sub - saharan africa to provide evidence - based information to confront this menace . to this end , it is important that controls selected for comparison with cases are recruited with a high degree of certainty that they indeed do not have stroke or tia to allow for valid comparisons to be made . in view of this simple , quick and accurate assessment of symptoms of stroke is needed for epidemiologic studies particularly those of the case  control type . in 2000 , meschia et al . developed the questionnaire for verifying stroke - free status ( qvsfs ) as a method for verifying the stroke - free phenotype in participants of clinical , epidemiological and genetic studies . having one or more affirmative answers to any of the questionnaire was associated with finding stroke , tia , or either stroke or tia on medical record review . jones et al . showed by directly interviewing participants and review of medical records that the qvsfs had a nppv and ppv of 0.96 and 0.71 respectively making the 8-item qvsfs a sensitive and valid tool , and a structured telephone interview format of questionnaire administration still had an excellent sensitivity of 1.0 , specificity of 0.86 , positive predictive value of 0.36 and negative predictive value of 1.0 among participants aged 60 years and above . the qvsfs is also reliable with intra - rater and inter - rater agreement of stroke - free status classification of 0.90 and 0.94 respectively . the qvsfs is easy to administer as a self - report pencil - and - paper questionnaire or by an interview in person or by telephone and has been translated into spanish by castillo et al . for use among hispanic populations . two questions in the instrument assess previous diagnosis of either stroke / tia together with six questions about stroke symptoms . thus not only is the 8-item qvsfs a useful tool in identifying stroke - free individuals but it could be used to screen for undiagnosed stroke . the sensitivity and specificity of having any of the six symptom questions for stroke detection was 0.82 and 0.62 respectively . indeed the qvsfs has been successfully used in the recruitment of controls involved genetic studies into ischaemic stroke , to screen for cerebrovascular end points in the carotid revascularisation endarterectomy versus stent trial ( crest )   and in the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke ( regards ) study . this instrument could have tremendous potential in developing countries where stroke prevalence is increasing , awareness of stroke symptoms low and the confirmation of stroke diagnosis either missed by health workers or constrained by the pervasive lack of neuro - imaging modalities . in these low literacy settings the lack of knowledge of stroke symptoms might impact negatively on the performance of stroke symptom questionnaires . furthermore there is a lack of specific medical terminology for symptoms of stroke in local dialects across sub - saharan africa . the performance of the questionnaire could be enhanced further by the introduction of culturally acceptable pictures of stroke symptoms . one of the key comments regarding the 8-item qvsfs questionnaire is that the benchmark for verification of strokes has relied on review of medical records of patients but this approach may be problematic in settings where medical records are kept under less than optimal circumstances and where patients may not always seek health services for ailments from medical facilities but from herbalists , chemical shops and so forth . an approach to overcome this limitation would be to examine participants by neurologists or to use a cranial ct scan for verification in a subset of participants . this study seeks to validate the 8-item qvsfs at 5 centers in nigeria and ghana which are involved in the on - going nih supported stroke investigative research and educational networks ( siren ) study . participants will be recruited from five tertiary referral medical centers in west africa namely the komfo anokye teaching hospital ( kath ) in kumasi , ghana ; the university college hospital ( uch ) , ibadan , nigeria ; federal medical centre ( fmc ) , abeokuta , nigeria ; ahmadu bello university hospital ( abuh ) , zaria , nigeria and aminu kano teaching hospital ( akth ) , kano , nigeria ( fig . kumasi where kath is situated is the principal city of the akan tribe in central ghana and serves a population of 4 million . uch and fmc situated in ibadan and abeokuta respectively are located in southern nigeria and serve a combined population of 4 million nigerians of predominantly yoruba ethnicity . abuh and akth in zaria and kano provide health care services to 15 million nigerians of mainly hausa and fulani descent . ethical approval for the study will be sought from the ethics committees of the 5 participating sites . the original questionnaire developed by meschia et al .   will be translated into the local languages ( yoruba  southern nigeria , hausa  northern nigeria , akan  middle & lower belts of ghana ) , pre - tested and back - translated into english language to establish semantic equivalence . at each of the study sites , a panel comprising of a neurologist , three to five doctors and nurses , and public health practitioners will translate the questionnaire into the local dialect by consensus . the translated versions of the questionnaires in 3 languages are shown in supplementary information section ( s1 ) . another version of the questionnaire will be developed where question items 3 to 8 will have line pictures of the neurological symptoms being elicited by the interviewer ( fig . participants attending general medicine and neurology out - patient clinic appointments will be approached and enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent . baseline demographic details will be obtained and the questionnaire administered by a medicine resident in the local dialect and the answers recorded as  yes  ,  no  , or  do n't know  to each question item . the version of the questionnaire without pictures will be administered first followed by the version with pictograms by the same interviewer . furthermore , participant awareness of known vascular risk factors such as hypertension , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidaemia , cigarette smoking , excessive alcohol intake , physical inactivity , known heart disorders , family history of stroke will be assessed using 8 questions assessing knowledge of the presence of these specific risk factors . after the interview participants will undergo a 3-staged evaluation by a neurologist . the first stage will involve a review of the medical records of patients to determine if a previous diagnosis of stroke has ever been made , the duration of stroke diagnosis , whether neuro - imaging information on stroke type is available . the second stage entails an examination for presence of hemiparesis , hemi - anesthesia , mono - ocular / binocular visual loss , hemianopsia , receptive or expressive aphasia , and cerebellar deficits . the third stage will comprise of an evaluation of a cranial ct scan in a subset of participants . this neuro - imaging validation will be performed within 48 h among a subset of subjects ( at least 4 stroke and 4 stroke - free ) per site after this thorough evaluation the neurologist makes a diagnosis which is our gold standard . assuming that the standard test has an accuracy of 75% as measured by the area under the roc curve ( auc ) , a sample of 35 cases and 35 controls achieve 82% power to detect an extra accuracy by the proposed test of 15% ( auc = 90% in the proposed test ) using a two - sided test at a significance level of 0.05 . the sample size required increases to 80 per group in order to detect a difference of 10% ( auc = 85% in the proposed test ) under the same conditions . thus , the sample size of 100 per linguistic category ( akan , yoruba , hausa ) will be sufficient detect an effect size as small as 10% allowing up to 10% false positive rates and control to case ratio of the standard deviation of the responses to be 0.5 as suggested by obuchowski and mcclish . given that the 8 items qvsfs is going to be translated into three ( yoruba , hausa , chi ) different languages , we will evaluate the reliability of the translation before it is implemented to predict stroke status using a sample size of 50 consistency and validity of the translation for each language using exploratory factor analysis and cronbach 's alpha . patients who score 0/8 will be deemed as stroke free whereas those with any positive score will be deemed as not stroke free according to the 8-item qvsfs . sensitivity analysis will be performed where  do n't know  will be assumed to be = 1 . baseline demographic characteristics between patients who are symptom free for stroke and those with stroke will be compared using either chi - squared test ( categorical variables ) or student 's t - test or mann  whitney 's u - test for means / medians respectively ( continuous variables ) . the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , positive and negative likelihood ratios as well as the accuracy and reliability of the 8-item qvsfs will be assessed in comparison with the benchmark stroke determination by history and examination by a neurologist . furthermore , the performance of the questionnaire will be compared with neuro - imaging results in a small randomly selected subset . the sensitivity and specificity of the 6 stroke symptom questions will be determined for stroke diagnosis among patients with stroke . the performance of the questionnaire will also be compared with the modified version of the questionnaire with images illustrating the neurological deficits being elicited by items 3 to 6 . we will use factor analysis approach to assess and confirm the structure relationship between each item and the qvsfs score overall . kappa statistics will be employed to compare inter - rater and intra - rater performance of the tool administered by medicine residents , at each site and also between study sites . participants will be recruited from five tertiary referral medical centers in west africa namely the komfo anokye teaching hospital ( kath ) in kumasi , ghana ; the university college hospital ( uch ) , ibadan , nigeria ; federal medical centre ( fmc ) , abeokuta , nigeria ; ahmadu bello university hospital ( abuh ) , zaria , nigeria and aminu kano teaching hospital ( akth ) , kano , nigeria ( fig . kumasi where kath is situated is the principal city of the akan tribe in central ghana and serves a population of 4 million . uch and fmc situated in ibadan and abeokuta respectively are located in southern nigeria and serve a combined population of 4 million nigerians of predominantly yoruba ethnicity . abuh and akth in zaria and kano provide health care services to 15 million nigerians of mainly hausa and fulani descent . ethical approval for the study will be sought from the ethics committees of the 5 participating sites . the original questionnaire developed by meschia et al .   will be translated into the local languages ( yoruba  southern nigeria , hausa  northern nigeria , akan  middle & lower belts of ghana ) , pre -

speaking western world populations , is a method for verifying stroke - free status in participants of clinical , epidemiological and genetic studies . however , the performance of this tool in settings where levels of education and awareness of stroke symptoms are low such as sub - saharan africa has not been conducted . the tool has tremendous potential for widespread use in regions such as ours where stroke incidence , prevalence and mortality are escalating and questions on the epidemiology and genetic underpinnings of the stroke epidemic remain unresolved . we propose to validate qvsfs for ascertainment of stroke - free status of control subjects enrolled in an ongoing stroke epidemiological study in west africa funded by the national institute of health for h3africa . the novel aspects of our validation study are : firstly , to carry out this validation study simultaneously at five tertiary hospitals across nigeria and ghana involving participants speaking three different languages ( yoruba , hausa and akan ) . the qvsfs will be translated into these languages and administered to participants enrolled from neurology and general clinics in these hospitals . secondly , given the low levels of education , the lack of awareness of stroke symptoms , and general paucity of semantically equivalent medical terminology in the local dialects for stroke symptoms in our settings , we will evaluate the performance of the tool with and without pictograms . finally , ascertainment of stroke status will be conducted by neurologists across the 5 sites using a combination of structured medical history , neurological examination , review of medical records and neuro - imaging ( gold standard ) compared with previously published studies which relied on medical records review and neurological examination . the 8-item qvsfs is a simple , accurate and cheap tool which could have widespread use for ascertaining stroke status in clinical , epidemiological and genetic studies in settings where facilities for stroke confirmation are lacking .\",\n",
      "       'the measurement of the common carotid artery intima and media combined layers as determined by high - resolution b - mode ultrasonography is now widely recognized as a useful tool for early identification for systemic atherosclerosis . intima - media thickness ( imt ) evaluation can identify individuals at risk for future cardiovascular events,17 and also evaluate the effectiveness of different therapy modalities for controlling morbidities that lead to the development of atherosclerotic - based diseases by identifying regression in imt values after such interventions.813 imt measurement methods have become more complex since the initial reports . the necessity of same - patient serial measurements in prospective cohort studies demanded a homogenization of the technique in order to avoid differences between repeated exams due to technical reproducibility difficulties as opposed to real imt changes . however , complex models require longer examination periods , are more expensive , and require auxiliary devices and additional human resources . the objective of this study was to test and describe a practical protocol to measure common carotid imt that uses the combined values of two longitudinal examination angles to increase its sensitivity . between february and september 2005 , 210 patients underwent duplex scan examination of carotid vessels at our institution . generally , the indication for carotid investigation was the occurrence of a neurological event ( stroke , tia , or both ) , assessment of cardiovascular status in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis , and preoperative evaluation for vascular surgeries . the remaining 206 patients were evaluated in a cross - sectional study where conventional carotid and vertebral duplex investigation was complimented by imt measurements taken from both common carotid arteries ( cca ) , except in five cases due to unilateral cca occlusion . all examinations were performed by a single physician with certified skills in duplex scan diagnostic procedures . the exams were initially performed with an atl hdi 1500 ultrasound system ( phillips medical systems , bothel , wa , usa ) using a 1012 mhz linear transducer . in the latter included patients , a logiq 5 ultrasound system ( ge healthcare , milwaukee , wi , usa ) and a 710 mhz linear transducer were used . imt measurements were obtained with the patient lying in the supine position and with the neck rotated to the opposite side of examination . cca images were obtained to measure imt by using three different angle views for each vessel ( figure 1 ) . initially , a transversal scanning view of the acc was performed in the longest extension possible from the base of the neck to the carotid bulb . at least three imt points were measured in the near and far walls in the most thickened area of each vessel . also , lateral wall measurements were taken when both thickening was evident and accurate images were possible . subsequently , the vessel was scanned by two longitudinal views : posterolateral ( pl ) , with the transducer positioned parallel to the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle , and anterolateral ( al ) , with the transducer positioned parallel to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle ; at least three imt measurements were obtained for each near and far wall . optimal b - mode settings of gain , depth , focal zone placement , and compression were individually adjusted for each vessel to enhance arterial wall structures and image quality . imt was measured by manual technique using electronic calipers , similar to the method of sidhu and desai.14 the maximum imt value was selected for each angle . an imt superior to 1.0 mm was considered to be an abnormal finding.15 quantitative imt measurement differences between the different angles were calculated by anova with the lsd post - hoc test . imt measurements were obtained with the patient lying in the supine position and with the neck rotated to the opposite side of examination . cca images were obtained to measure imt by using three different angle views for each vessel ( figure 1 ) . initially , a transversal scanning view of the acc was performed in the longest extension possible from the base of the neck to the carotid bulb . at least three imt points were measured in the near and far walls in the most thickened area of each vessel . also , lateral wall measurements were taken when both thickening was evident and accurate images were possible . subsequently , the vessel was scanned by two longitudinal views : posterolateral ( pl ) , with the transducer positioned parallel to the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle , and anterolateral ( al ) , with the transducer positioned parallel to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle ; at least three imt measurements were obtained for each near and far wall . optimal b - mode settings of gain , depth , focal zone placement , and compression were individually adjusted for each vessel to enhance arterial wall structures and image quality . imt was measured by manual technique using electronic calipers , similar to the method of sidhu and desai.14 the maximum imt value was selected for each angle . an imt superior to 1.0 mm was considered to be an abnormal finding.15 quantitative imt measurement differences between the different angles were calculated by anova with the lsd post - hoc test . the population studied had a mean age of 60.812.9 years , and 106 ( 51.5% ) of the individuals were male . reliable measurement images could be achieved in 406 vessels in the transversal angle view , 404 in the longitudinal posterior view , and 398 in the longitudinal anterior angle view . the mean time necessary to take measurements was 8.11.24 minutes . comparing the thickest measurement obtained from all views , 270 ( 66.3% ) carotid arteries had an imt greater than 1 mm . the mean imt values achieved with the different incidences were 1.260.6 mm ( transversal ) , 1.170.54 mm ( longitudinal al ) , and 1.180.58 mm ( longitudinal pl ) . detailed data of mean imt for each angle view are presented in table 1 . a significant difference in imt measurement values was observed when the three angles of examination plus the combined positive results of both longitudinal angles were compared by anova ( p=0.005 ) . the lsd post - hoc test identified that the combined results of longitudinal views had similar results to transversal views ( p=0.28 ) and higher imt means than isolated al or pl longitudinal views ( p=0.02 and 0.05 , respectively ) . a direct comparison of the different angles of measurement was obtained with mcnemar s test . no statistical difference was observed in comparison between al and pl longitudinal angles ( p=0.63 ) . the transversal view identified a greater number of arteries with increased imt in comparison to the anterior or posterior longitudinal examination angles ( p<0.001 for both ) . the combined results of the two longitudinal angles show superior results over isolated longitudinal views ( p<0.001 for both ) and similar results to transversal measurements ( p=0.52 ) . imt measurement is a simple , feasible , and cost - effective method for assessing systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk in adults.1 also , is somewhat easy to provide specific training for professionals with previous vascular ultrasound experience to take imt measurements that meet good quality standards after a short period of practice.14 in this study , we proposed an objective and practical method to evaluate imt with the intention of improving the measurement quality by a short increase in the time required for carotid examination while maintaining its characteristic simplicity . specific software1620 has been developed for automatic imt evaluation that minimizes the subjectivity of direct eye observation . computer - assisted imt measurements are widely used in other countries for longitudinal cohort studies and are encouraged by latest consensus.2122 however , such an option demands complex human and material resources . although software can perform more than a hundred measurements from each segment in a short time , the results obtained were not proven to be more accurate than manual measurements.23 another improvement is the concomitant use of ecg24 during examination , which allows the observer to take measurements only during systolic activity , preventing small differences that could appear during the diastolic period when the inner arterial layers are less compressed . also , external devices that measure head rotation and transducer position in degrees , such as the meijer arc , make it possible to reproduce the same positions in repeated examinations . these improvements bring many advantages and raise the quality of the data obtained , but such procedures also require more time24 and are more expensive . the application of such protocols should be preceded by a careful cost - benefit analysis that depends on the objectives of each investigation . only the sternocleidomastoid and the carotid bulb were used , which represent simple anatomical references that remain virtually unchanged over time . the transversal angle view provided a panoramic observation of the cca , thus allowing the observer to identify and measure the thickest imt points , even of the side walls . however , measurements taken from the transversal view may result in poor quality images , which are subject to many artifacts that are mainly the result of refraction from the side walls . rather than being a proper measurement angle , previous authors have performed imt measurements from a single longitudinal view,14,2526 which can provide limited observation of the vessel walls , leading to the underestimation of early atherosclerotic processes . we avoided directly comparing our findings with these reports due to the methodological differences of each study . instead , we used the numbers obtained in our investigation to compare the combined results of imt measured from the two longitudinal views with results from each single longitudinal view . as shown in the results , isolated longitudinal views had poorer sensitivity on identifying areas of increased imt . the longitudinal views obtained in this investigation provided at least 12 different measurement points ( three from each wall ) , covering the whole extension of the cca in perpendicular angles to generate virtual tri - dimensional information about carotid wall thickness . although some authors believe that the near wall images are not accurate enough for imt measurements,2728 we decided to consider these values . in many cases , the near wall presents layers that are far thicker than those in the far wall , which may even have normal values . thus , ignoring these findings would underestimate the real state of the carotid artery atherosclerotic process.2930 recent studies revealed a tendency to use the mean maximum thickness of the cca , carotid bulbs , and internal carotid artery ( ica).31 in this investigation , we avoided taking measurements from the carotid bulb or ica for the following reasons : first , even though bulb and ica measurements may be worthwhile , they present limitations : as opposed to cca , they can be measured only in limited angles that may not reflect the thickest portions of vessel wall.3233 also , up to 52% of images can fail to obtain accurate bulb and ica measurements.34 the variance of results of bulb and ica imt amongst repeated examinations and different physicians is higher than cca measurements , making longitudinal comparisons more unreliable.3537 finally , cca , bulb , and ica have morphological differences that make direct imt comparison among them inaccurate.21 yet , cca / bulb / ica measurements do not appear to be superior to cca imt alone.38 we believe that the suggested protocol is an inexpensive method to measure imt . we avoided expressing costs in numbers because values may vary from country to country and from private to public healthcare models . thus , the eventual cost calculation in our institution may not reflect the reality for many readers . although we did not show numbers to confirm our impression , we judged that the presented technique is less expensive because it does not uses complimentary devices and does not depend on external software to analyze the obtained images . the acquisition and maintenance of the necessary devices would certainly impact the final costs of examinations . the mean time expended in taking all measurements was about 8 minutes . this value is shorter than other models suggested,24 thus representing less of an impact in terms of physician human resources than more complex models . the protocol presented is a fast and practical method for obtaining common carotid artery intima - media thickness measurements . the combined values of anterolateral and posterolateral longitudinal views provide a more sensitive evaluation of the inner layers of the carotid walls than isolated longitudinal views .',\n",
      "       \"approximately , one - third of patients with symptomatic vte manifests pe , whereas two - thirds manifest dvt alone . both dvt and pe can be clinically silent ( asymptomatic ) and hence not suspected . if undiagnosed , asymptomatic vte can lead to chronic venous disease or recurrent vte and long - term debilitating sequelae such as postthrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . vte is not only disabling but also prolongs hospital stay and increases the cost of treatment . along with myocardial infarction and arrhythmia ( due to electrolyte imbalance ) , pe is one of the commonest causes of sudden unexplained deaths in hospitalized patients . it is estimated that 20 million cases of lower extremity dvt occur in the usa alone . the prevailing notion that the incidence of vte in asians is less than that in the western population has been disproved by recent studies . the incidence of postoperative dvt in indian patients undergoing major lower limb surgery is as high ( 43.2% and 60% patients in the groups with and without prophylaxis , respectively ) as seen in the western world . given the growing burden of vte in india and lack of substantial indian data on characteristics of vte patients , use of diagnostics tools , prophylaxis , treatment options , and clinical outcomes in vte , there was a need to systematically collect such data . data on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , predictors of mortality in acute dvt , management strategies and temporal trends in vte . the intent was to collect and provide data that would reflect actual day - to - day clinical practice , rather than results of highly controlled clinical trials with restricted study populations and imposed experimental intervention . consecutive medical records of inpatients and outpatients between january 2006 and december 2010 , meeting eligibility criteria ( confirmed diagnosis of acute or acute - on - chronic dvt by doppler ultrasound scan and/or pe by chest computed tomography scan , pulmonary angiography or v / q scan ) were identified and collected from the general medical records and/or radiology departments at each of the three participating hospitals . hospital data were used to obtain the total number of patients who were annually registered at the hospital from 2006 to 2010 . data were processed and analyzed using sas ( version 9.1 , statistical analysis system ) . for the purpose of analysis ,  acute - on - chronic  descriptive statistics were used to present patient characteristics , management strategies , and clinical outcomes of patients . annual incidence rates ( 95% ci ) of vte per 100,000 hospital registrations over a period of 5 years were reported for each site . fisher 's exact test was used to determine differences in the incidence of acute dvt ( pe ) over the years 20062010 . armitage trend test was used to examine the direction ( positive or negative ) of the trend . as primary analyses the remaining 41% ( 393/949 ) medical records were not included because they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria . data from seven patients were excluded as there was no radiologically confirmed diagnosis of pe . a total of 64% ( 352/549 ) patients had acute dvt without pe , 23% ( 124/549 ) had acute dvt with pe , and 13% ( 73/549 ) had pe . eighty - seven percent ( 476/549 ) of patients had acute dvt ( pe ) , and 36% ( 197/549 ) had pe (  acute dvt ) [ figure 1 ] . overall distribution of venous thromboembolism patients ( n = 549 ) a total of 21% ( 115/549 ) of patients visited the hospitals directly without being referred by a physician . venous thromboembolism patients referred from different medical specialties ( n=434 ) the demographic characteristics of the vte patients are mentioned in table 2 . demographic characteristics of venous thromboembolism patients ( n=549 ) a total of 182 patients had evidence of one risk factor , 126 had evidence of two risk factors , 70 had evidence of three risk factors and 31 had four or more risk factors recorded . patients undergoing orthopedic surgery constituted 22% ( 33/152 ) of all surgical patients [ table 3 ] . risk factors for venous thromboembolism based on a review of the available records , 157 patients had a single co - morbidity , 81 had two co - morbidities , 23 had three co - morbidities , and 16 had four or more co - morbidities .

81/549 ) was diagnosed with vte during the postoperative period . figure 3 shows the proportion of patients with vte at different time points during the postoperative period . of those diagnosed beyond 6 weeks diagnosis of venous thromboembolism during the postoperative period ( n = 81 ) the most common ( 73% ) symptom was  swelling of the limb  among patients with vte [ table 6 ] pe was confirmed by pulmonary angiography in 27% of all the patients [ table 7 ] . heparin ( low molecular weight heparin [ lmwh]/unfractionated heparin [ ufh ] ) alone , a combination of heparin ( lmwh / ufh ) and oral anticoagulant ( warfarin ) , and fondaparinux sodium alone were recommended to 82% ( 420/515 ) , 13% ( 66/515 ) , and 2% ( 12/515 ) patients , respectively as initial anticoagulation . five percent ( 25/515 ) of patients were recommended lmwh alone , and 76% ( 393/515 ) were recommended either warfarin or acenocoumarol alone for long - term anticoagulation . the median duration of initial anticoagulation was 5 days while that of long - term anticoagulation was 180 days ( 6 months ) . anticoagulants were needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% ( 9/515 ) patients . clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism during hospital stay clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism the annual incidence of acute dvt ( pe ) increased from 2006 to 2010 at all the three sites [ figure 4 ] . however , a formal site - wise statistical analysis could not be performed to analyse trends in the incidence rates in acute dvt ( pe ) and pe alone as there were zero observations in some instances . incidence of acute deep vein thrombosis ( with or without pulmonary embolism ) over a 5 years period ( 20062010 ) at three sites pe was confirmed by pulmonary angiography in 27% of all the patients [ table 7 ] . heparin ( low molecular weight heparin [ lmwh]/unfractionated heparin [ ufh ] ) alone , a combination of heparin ( lmwh / ufh ) and oral anticoagulant ( warfarin ) , and fondaparinux sodium alone were recommended to 82% ( 420/515 ) , 13% ( 66/515 ) , and 2% ( 12/515 ) patients , respectively as initial anticoagulation . five percent ( 25/515 ) of patients were recommended lmwh alone , and 76% ( 393/515 ) were recommended either warfarin or acenocoumarol alone for long - term anticoagulation . the median duration of initial anticoagulation was 5 days while that of long - term anticoagulation was 180 days ( 6 months ) . anticoagulants were needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% ( 9/515 ) patients . clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism during hospital stay clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism the annual incidence of acute dvt ( pe ) increased from 2006 to 2010 at all the three sites [ figure 4 ] . however , a formal site - wise statistical analysis could not be performed to analyse trends in the incidence rates in acute dvt ( pe ) and pe alone as there were zero observations in some instances . incidence of acute deep vein thrombosis ( with or without pulmonary embolism ) over a 5 years period ( 20062010 ) at three sites to our knowledge , this is the first multicenter , retrospective registry in india involving patients with vte that reflect real - world clinical practice . in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly a disease of older age , 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years , particularly those with pe . in a study from north india , men constituted 70% of our registry , more than those reported from vellore registry ( 48% ) , but similar to those reported in the endorse ( epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting ) study ( 69% ) . one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine ( thrombophilia marker ) in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study . fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy , which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis . this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives , and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy . a total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists . the majority ( 82% ) of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical ( 15% ) specialties as against a referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore . our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease . majority ( 53% ) of patients in our study had co - morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus ; it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment ( s ) and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist ( investigator ) . most ( 89% ) of these patients had swelling of the ( lower ) limb . it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like  swelling of limb ,  instead visited their family physician . it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist . patients with a history of vte are about 8 times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high - risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe . prior history of dvt was the most ( 34% ) common risk factor in patients who had only dvt , whereas past history of pe , trauma , and immobilization for more than 3 days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe . our results ( major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in 3% patients ) appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study , which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery . other studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery . however , in our study , only 7% of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor . among the malignancies , genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence ( 45% ) . hypertension ( 25% ) was the most common co - morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus ( 19% ) in this patient population . in addition , obesity ( 11% ) was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe . our findings support an asian ( korean ) study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte . co - morbid neurological disease ( other than stroke ) and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt ( 10% ) and pe ( 11% ) respectively . both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time , predisposing them to vte . venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively . in our study , venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one - third of the patients . perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors . overall , most ( 93% ) patients were managed as inpatients ( 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte ) . a mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data . in selected low - risk patients , outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered . this approach was observed in a small proportion ( 7% ) of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis , nearly all ( 97% ) of whom had only dvt . the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study ( 15% ) was half of that ( 30% ) reported in vellore registry . this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites . most ( 40% ; 32/81 ) dvt cases were diagnosed between 2 and 6 postoperative weeks , but pe in most cases ( 70% ; 7/10 ) was diagnosed during the first postoperative week . we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less ( 6% ; 7/124 ) frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% ( 64/352 ) and 14% ( 10/73 ) of acute dvt alone and pe alone , respectively . the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines , which recommend at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation ( lmwh , fondaparinux , intravenous ufh , or subcutaneous ufh ) and at least 3 months of long - term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist . bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient 's age advances . in this registry , anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population . the prospective reite registry has reported a rate of 3% for major / fatal bleeds . thus , the fear of bleeding complications , which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment , appears to be minimal . dvt complicated by pe ( 60% ) and pe alone ( 75% ) were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone ( 25% ) . similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis , we report a hospital readmission rate of 6% ; however we do not know the cause for readmission . the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte . over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment . in our study , the hospital discharge rate ( 97% ) was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al . ( hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% ) at a university hospital in delhi . our data show a significant increase in acute dvt ( pe ) from 2006 to 2010 . this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities , such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted . although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 , the burden of pe is almost double ( 13% of all vte ) of 7% , rate reported at christian medical college , vellore during a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 . our finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies . this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients , although a robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted . controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding . follow - up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available . in cases of death , further , the clinic charts reviewed in this study included a mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments , limiting the generalizability of the study results . despite these limitations , this study provides large amount of useful information in a short span of time on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , management strategies , and temporal trends in vte , based on  real world  data that reflect actual day - to - day clinical practice over a period of 5 years across three sites in india . we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india . real world data reflecting actual day - to - day clinical practice in vte over a period of 5 years across three sites in india showed that vte is not uncommon in indian patients and that acute dvt was responsible for the substantial burden of vte . we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india . liesel c. dsilva is and dr . sadhna j. joglekar was full - time employee of glaxosmithkline pharmaceuticals limited .\",\n",
      "       'coronary artery disease ( cad ) is the emerging cause of morbidity and mortality in developing world . it provides an excellent resolution for visualization of the coronary arteries for catheter - based or operating interventions . although the association of this technique with major complications such as mortality is highly uncommon , it is frequently associated with various cardiac and noncardiac complications . computed tomography ( ct ) coronary angiography is a promising technique for the evaluation of cad noninvasively . it assesses disease within the coronary artery and provides qualitative and quantitative information about nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque burden within the vessel wall . thus , ct angiography - based disease evaluation may provide clinically more significant information than conventional angiography . the introduction of multi - slice computed tomography ( msct ) technology such as 64-slice , 128-slice , 256-slice , and now 320-slice msct has produced a high diagnostic accuracy of ct coronary angiography . it has consistently showed to have a very high negative predictive value ( well above 90% ) in ruling out patients with significant cad defined as coronary luminal stenosis of > 50% . the american college of cardiology / american heart association recommends that coronary angiography should be performed before valve surgery in men aged > 40 years , women aged > 35 years with coronary risk factors and in postmenopausal women . the prevalence of cad in patients undergoing valve replacement is 2040% in developed countries . in the previous studies , the incidence of angiographically proven cad in acquired valvular diseases has been shown to vary widely from 9% to 41% . in aortic stenosis , we aimed to report the diagnostic performance of 128-slice ct coronary angiography in 50 patients undergoing for major noncoronary cardiac surgery referred for diagnostic invasive coronary angiography to assess the extent and severity of coronary stenosis . during january 2013 to december 2014 , we enrolled fifty major noncoronary cardiac surgery patients scheduled for invasive coronary angiography who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria of age 40 years , having low or intermediate probability of cad , left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) > 35% , and patient giving informed consent for undergoing msct and conventional coronary angiography . those having any contraindication for contrast injection , lvef < 35% , high pretest probability of cad , and hemodynamic instability were excluded from the study . patients with heart rates of > 70 bpm received ( unless they had known overt heart failure or electrocardiogram ( ecg ) atrioventricular conduction abnormalities ) a single oral dose of 100 mg metoprolol 45 min before the scan . patients with heart rates of > 80 bpm received an additional oral dose of metoprolol if not contraindicated . all patients were scanned with a 128-slice ct scanner ( siemens , somatom definition as ) equipped with a new feature in msct technology , so - called z - axis flying - focus technology . the central 32 detector rows acquire 0.6-mm slices , and the flying - focus spot switches back and forth between 2 z positions between each reading . two slices per detector row are acquired , which results in a higher oversampling rate in the z - axis , thereby reducing artifacts related to the spiral acquisition and improving spatial resolution down to 0.4 mm . a bolus of 6580 ml contrast material ( omnipaque ) was injected through an arm vein at a flow rate of 5 ml / s . a bolus tracking technique was used to synchronize the arrival of contrast in the coronary arteries with the initiation of the scan . to monitor the arrival of contrast material , axial scans were obtained at the level of the ascending aorta with a delay of 10 s after the start of the contrast injection . the scan was automatically started when a threshold of 150 hounsfield units was reached in a region of interest positioned in the ascending aorta . images were reconstructed with ecg gating to obtain optimal , motion - free image quality . all scans were performed within 2 weeks of the msct coronary diagnostic angiogram . a single observer unaware of the multi - slice ct results identified coronary lesion as a single vessel , double vessel , or triple vessel disease . all lesion , regardless of size , were included for comparison with ct coronary angiography . lesions were classified as having nonsignificant disease ( luminal irregularities or < 50% stenosis ) or as having significant stenosis . stenosis was evaluated in two orthogonal views and classified as significant if the mean lumen diameter reduction was 50% using a validated quantitative coronary angiography ( qca ) . all scans were analyzed independently by a radiologist and a cardiologist who were unaware of the results of conventional coronary angiography . total calcium scores of all patients were calculated with dedicated software and expressed as agatston scores . the agatston score is a commonly used scoring method that calculates the total amount of calcium on the basis of the number , areas , and peak hounsfield units of the detected calcified lesions . all available coronary segments were visually scored for the presence of > 50% considered as significant stenosis . maximum intensity projections were used to identify coronary lesions and ( curved ) multiplanar reconstructions to classify lesions as significant or nonsignificant . data were analyzed using statistical system spss version 20 software ( chicago , il , usa ) . the diagnostic performance of ct coronary angiography for the detection of significant lesions in coronary arteries with qca as the standard of reference is presented as sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values , and positive and negative likelihood ratios with the corresponding exact 95% of confidence interval ( cis ) . comparison between ct and conventional coronary angiography was performed on the two level vessel by vessel ( no or any disease per vessel ) , and patient by patient ( no or any disease per patient ) . all scans were performed within 2 weeks of the msct coronary diagnostic angiogram . a single observer unaware of the multi - slice ct results identified coronary lesion as a single vessel , double vessel , or triple vessel disease . all lesion , regardless of size , were included for comparison with ct coronary angiography . lesions were classified as having nonsignificant disease ( luminal irregularities or < 50% stenosis ) or as having significant stenosis . stenosis was evaluated in two orthogonal views and classified as significant if the mean lumen diameter reduction was 50% using a validated quantitative coronary angiography ( qca ) . all scans were analyzed independently by a radiologist and a cardiologist who were unaware of the results of conventional coronary angiography . total calcium scores of all patients were calculated with dedicated software and expressed as agatston scores . the agatston score is a commonly used scoring method that calculates the total amount of calcium on the basis of the number , areas , and peak hounsfield units of the detected calcified lesions . all available coronary segments were visually scored for the presence of > 50% considered as significant stenosis . maximum intensity projections were used to identify coronary lesions and ( curved ) multiplanar reconstructions to classify lesions as significant or nonsignificant . data were analyzed using statistical system spss version 20 software ( chicago , il , usa ) . the diagnostic performance of ct coronary angiography for the detection of significant lesions in coronary arteries with qca as the standard of reference is presented as sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values , and positive and negative likelihood ratios with the corresponding exact 95% of confidence interval ( cis ) . comparison between ct and conventional coronary angiography was performed on the two level vessel by vessel ( no or any disease per vessel ) , and patient by patient ( no or any disease per patient ) . in this study , 29 ( 58% ) subjects were female , and 21 ( 42% ) were male showing an average age of 50.36  8.39 years . of fifty patients 24 ( 48% ) , 13 ( 26% ) , eight ( 16% ) , and five ( 10% ) underwent mitral valve replacement , double valve replacement ( dvr ) , aortic valve replacement , and other surgeries , respectively . high distribution of cad risk factors such as hypertension ( 24% ) , smoking ( 22% ) , and dyslipidemia ( 18% ) was observed in the study group . the mean creatinine level was 0.766  0.17 and average dye used in conventional angiography was 48.5  26.6 whereas for ct angiography it was 72.8  6.32 . average radiation dose in conventional coronary angiography and msct coronary angiography was 5.2 msv and 9.2 msv , respectively . the majority of the patients had sinus rhythm ( 68% ) , whereas atrial fibrillation was found in 32% of the subjects . patients included in the study had low to intermediate probability of cad . in this study , three patients had complications after conventional angiography . complications were of local site hematoma , acute kidney injury managed conservatively , and acute heart failure . a patient who developed hematoma was obese female patients with body mass index > 30 kg / m . the patient suffered from pseudoaneurysm , had hospitalized for 9 days , which leads to increased morbidity and cost of hospital stay . the diagnostic accuracy of ct coronary angiography was evaluated regarding true positive , true negative values and is presented in table 1 . the overall sensitivity and specificity of ct angiography technique was 100% ( 95% ci : 39.76%100% ) and 91.30% ( 95% ci : 79.21%97.58% ) , respectively [ table 2 ] . the positive predictive value ( 50% ; 95% ci : 15.70%84.30% ) and negative predictive value ( 100% ; 95% ci : 91.59%100% ) of ct angiography were also fairly high in these patients . recent reports from multiple studies demonstrated that recent - generation msct scanners showed promise for noninvasive detection of coronary stenosis however , until now no studies were found regarding the clinical efficacy or prognostic value of 128-slice ct coronary angiography versus conventional invasive coronary angiography in the diagnosis of patients planned for major noncoronary surgeries such as dvr , bentall , atrial septal defect closure , etc . in our study , we reported 8% cad prevalence in patients planned for major noncoronary cardiac surgery . we performed conventional and msct coronary angiography in all patients and the results showed that ct coronary angiography with invasive coronary angiography as the reference standard had a considerably high sensitivity ( 100% ) and specificity ( 95.65% ) . the health economic model using invasive coronary angiography as the reference standard showed that at a pretest probability of cad of 70% or lower , ct coronary angiography resulted in lower cost per patient with a true positive diagnosis . at a pretest probability of cad of 70% or higher , invasive coronary angiography was associated with a lower cost per patient with a true positive diagnosis . in our study population , two patients developed local site complications in the form of hematoma and pseudoaneurysm after conventional angiography . hence , msct coronary angiography will be more favorable in female obese patients with intermediate likelihood of cad . hence , msct coronary angiography will be cost - effective in patients of valvular heart diseases . however , ct angiography suffers from a drawback that average amount of dye used in msct coronary angiography were 72.8  6.32 ml which is higher than average amount of dye required for conventional angiography ( 48.6  26.6 ml ) . hence , the use of ct coronary angiography could not be used in patients with known renal dysfunction , where reduction of contrast dye load is highly advocated . our results show that 128-slice ct coronary angiography is a reliable technique to detect coronary stenosis in patients planned for noncoronary cardiac surgery . although there has been important technological progress in the development of ct coronary angiography , its clinical application remains limited . a study wth large numbers of patients is required for the recommendation of only ct coronary angiography for the coronary evaluation in major non - cardiac surgeries . mehta institute of cardiology and research center ( affiliated to bj medical college , ahmedabad , gujarat , india ) . u.n . mehta institute of cardiology and research center ( affiliated to bj medical college , ahmedabad , gujarat , india ) .',\n",

4/10 ) , improved functional status ( 38 - 40% ) and increased claudication distance ( 70 m ) . although little is known regarding the nonoperative management of spinal stenosis , conservative treatment usually includes physical therapy , nsaids , muscle relaxants and/or mild narcotics , as needed by individual patients . in addition , local anesthetics and corticosteroids are usually administered to relieve symptoms of persistent pain . although lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections have not consistently shown efficacy , they may relieve pain in patients with symptoms resulting from inflammation at the interface between the nerve root and the compressing tissues . epidural injection of steroids is thought to reduce inflammatory edema of the injured nerve root and thus improve intraneural blood flow , decrease sensitization of the dorsal horn neurons and suppress the transmission of nociceptive c - fibers . local anesthetics induce sympathetic nerve blockade and vasodilation , thereby improving blood flow to the ischemic neural element . co - administration of hyaluronidase has also been used to enhance the effect of lysis of epidural adhesion . epidural injection of steroids and local anesthetics in patients with spinal stenosis has been shown to result in only short - lived improvements in pain and function , because the symptoms of spinal stenosis reflect a combination of pathological processes caused by space occupying lesions or fibrosis , such as interruption of blood flow , venous congestion , ischemia , axonal damage and intraneural fibrosis . since serial injections of conventional epidural steroids into our three patients did not result in symptom relief , we utilized an alternative technique focused on resolving the underlying pathophysiology of spinal stenosis , consisting of percutaneous epidural foraminoplasty with 3 fr fogarty catheters , balloon decompression of the epidural space of the intervertebral foramina , and administration of drugs to the target region . fogarty catheters were initially utilized in thrombectomy to remove fresh , soft emboli and thrombi from arteries and veins . using its pliable distal tip , designed to minimize trauma to the venous valves , to manipulate around perineural structures enables a relatively safe procedure . instead of inflating with air , however , we used contrast medium , enabling visualization of ballooning and de - ballooning during the procedure . several factors may be responsible for post - decompression pain relief and functional improvement in our patients . for example , balloon distension of the epidural space may result in effective mechanical detachment of perineural adhesion , which may play a role in restoring the mobility of the nerve roots to some extent , thus contributing to long - term symptom relief . moreover , mechanical ballooning of a narrow intervertebral foramen may reduce venous congestion and mechanical irritation . venous congestion has been regarded essential in precipitating circulatory disturbance , thus inducing neurogenic claudication . furthermore , initial improvements of symptoms after the decompressive procedure may be due to local anesthetics and steroids that reach the areas causing these symptoms . balloon dilatation and adhesiolysis , however , may also contribute to the effective delivery of epidural injections to regions of spinal stenosis , thereby improving the effects of drugs in these target lesions . we found that balloon decompression did not yield consistent results in our patients , which may be due to differences in disease severity and/or physical condition . patient one achieved 4 months of modest symptom relief , whereas patient two had 6 months symptom - free . patient three showed incomplete improvement , but this seemed acceptable because this patient was considered a candidate for a spinal cord stimulator . additional studies involving more patients are needed to establish the proper criteria for selecting patients for balloon decompression . patient safety should also be considered in the effects of acute compression on spinal nerves . increasing pressure and its duration have been found to induce more pronounced effects such as intraneural edema . the safe limits of nerve compression in vivo have not been established , however , transforaminal balloon decompression would be regarded as safe if the balloon pressure is increased slowly and the procedure is limited to less than 2 - 4 h . there have been previous attempt to use various balloon catheter for epidural adhesiolysis in patients with failed back surgery syndrome . to our knowledge , however , this is the first report describing the use of epidural balloon catheters to decompress the intervertebral foraminal space in the treatment of patients with spinal stenosis . over the past several years , minimally invasive surgical techniques have been introduced , using smaller incisions and more limited removal of the innate structure , to achieve decompression . although our case series provides only anecdotal evidence , the results suggest that transforaminal decompression using a balloon may have potential in the nonsurgical treatment of this condition by modifying the underlying pathophysiology of segmental stenosis . ongoing randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes will address the effects of this treatment on pain improvement , functional score and claudication distance .'],\n",
